    Our study introduces ST360IQ, a no-reference quality assessment method that extracts and evaluates tangent viewports from key areas of the image using vision-transformer-based modules. This approach aggregates scores to produce a final quality assessment. Tested on OIQA and CVIQ datasets, ST360IQ shows improved correlation with human-perceived image quality compared to current methods.
