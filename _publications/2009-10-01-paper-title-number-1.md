In our study, we address the challenge of assessing the quality of 360Â° images, which are increasingly popular for their immersive and interactive experiences. Traditional methods for standard images are inadequate for this high-resolution, spherical data. We introduce a no-reference quality assessment method, ST360IQ, which extracts tangent viewports from important areas of the omnidirectional image. Using a vision-transformer-based module, it processes these selective patches to estimate a quality score for each viewport, then aggregates these scores into a final quality score. Our method, tested on OIQA and CVIQ benchmark datasets, shows superior correlation with human-perceived image quality compared to current state-of-the-art approaches.
