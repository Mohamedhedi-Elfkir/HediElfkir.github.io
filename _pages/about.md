Hello, I am Mohamed Hedi Elfkir (you can call me Hedi). I am a Master's student in the [Department of Computer Engineering](https://w3.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/) at [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/). I am part of the LiRa Research Group under the supervision of Professor [Ozgur S. Oguz](https://oz-oguz.github.io/). I obtained my B.Sc. degree from the [Computer Engineering Department](https://www.cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/) at [Hacettepe University](https://www.hacettepe.edu.tr/).

During my bachelorâ€™s degree, I worked in the [Hacettepe University Computer Vision Laboratory](https://vision.cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/) under the supervision of Professor [Erkut Erdem](https://web.cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/~erkut/) on Omnidirectional Images. During this time, I collaborated closely with Professor [Aykut Erdem](https://aykuterdem.github.io/) from the [KUIS AI Center](https://ai.ku.edu.tr/), [Nevrez Imamoglu](https://nevrez.github.io/) from the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), and Professor [Cagri Ozcinar](https://cagriozcinar.netlify.app/) from the Samsung Research Institute UK (SRUK).
